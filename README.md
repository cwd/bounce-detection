# cwd/bounce-detection

This uses the bounce detection (regexp) of voku/bounce-mail-handler which is an extended fork of instaclick's PHPMailer-BMH which is on the other hand a Fork of WorxWare's PHPMailer-BMH.

This lib doesnt care where your mail comes from, so there is no IMAP integration like in PHPMailer-BMH. It juses parses the content you give to it.
